# MEOW Orchestration Skill

Use this skill when working with MEOW (Meow Executors Orchestrate Work) - an AI agent orchestration tool. Applies when:
- Working in projects containing a `.meow/` directory
- Creating or editing `.meow.toml` workflow templates
- Running meow CLI commands (run, status, stop, resume, ls)
- Monitoring agents via tmux sessions
- Setting up new MEOW projects with `meow init`
- Debugging workflow execution issues

---

## Overview

MEOW coordinates AI agents through tmux sessions and TOML templates. Key principles:
- **Dumb orchestrator, smart templates** - orchestrator routes events; templates define behavior
- **Local-first** - no cloud, no Python dependencies, just Go + tmux
- **7 executors only** - shell, spawn, kill, expand, branch, foreach, agent

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Quick install (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akatz-ai/meow/main/install.sh | sh

# With Go
go install github.com/akatz-ai/meow/cmd/meow@latest

# Or clone and build
git clone https://github.com/akatz-ai/meow
cd meow && make install
```

### Initialize Project

```bash
meow init
```

Creates:
```
.meow/
├── config.toml      # Project configuration
├── templates/       # Your workflow templates
├── lib/             # Standard library (linked)
├── adapters/        # Agent adapters
├── runs/            # Runtime state (gitignored)
└── logs/            # Execution logs (gitignored)
```

### Run a Workflow

```bash
# Foreground (see output)
meow run my-template

# Background (daemonized)
meow run my-template -d

# With variables
meow run my-template --var task="Fix the bug" --var branch=feature-x
```

### Monitor

```bash
# Current workflows
meow status

# Watch mode (live updates)
meow status --watch

# List all workflows
meow ls

# List with filters
meow ls --status running
meow ls --stale
```

### Stop a Workflow

```bash
meow stop <workflow-id>
```

## Project Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `templates/` | Your workflow definitions (.meow.toml files) |
| `lib/` | Standard library templates (agent-persistence, claude-utils, etc.) |
| `adapters/` | Agent-specific adapters (how to spawn different agents) |
| `runs/` | Active workflow state (ephemeral, gitignored) |
| `logs/` | Execution logs per workflow (gitignored) |

## Workflow Lifecycle

```
Template (.meow.toml)
       |
       v
   meow run
       |
       v
  Orchestrator (reads template, manages state)
       |
       +---> spawn agent(s) in tmux
       |
       +---> send prompts via agent steps
       |
       +---> wait for `meow done` calls
       |
       +---> route events between steps
       |
       v
  Workflow complete (all steps done)
```

### Step Status Lifecycle

```
pending --> running --> completing --> done
               |            |
               |            +---> (back to running if validation fails)
               |
               +---> failed
```

## The 7 Executors

| Executor | Run By | Completes When |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| `shell` | Orchestrator | Command exits |
| `spawn` | Orchestrator | Agent session started |
| `kill` | Orchestrator | Agent session terminated |
| `expand` | Orchestrator | Template steps inserted |
| `branch` | Orchestrator | Condition evaluated, branch expanded |
| `foreach` | Orchestrator | All iterations complete |
| `agent` | Agent | Agent calls `meow done` |

## Agent Communication

### Environment Variables

When inside a MEOW workflow, agents have access to:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MEOW_AGENT` | Agent name |
| `MEOW_WORKFLOW` | Workflow ID |
| `MEOW_STEP` | Current step ID |
| `MEOW_ORCH_SOCK` | Socket path for IPC |

### Commands Agents Can Call

```bash
# Signal step completion
meow done

# With output data (passed to downstream steps)
meow done --output result=success --output count=42

# With JSON output
meow done --output-json '{"files": ["a.go", "b.go"]}'

# Emit an event (for event-driven patterns)
meow event task-blocked --data reason="waiting for approval"

# Wait for an event
meow await-event approval-granted --timeout 5m

# Check another step's status
meow step-status setup-step
```

**Note:** `meow done` and `meow event` are no-ops when `MEOW_ORCH_SOCK` is not set. This allows the same hooks to work inside and outside MEOW.

## Monitoring Agents

### Tmux Sessions

Agents run in tmux sessions named: `meow-<workflow-id>-<agent-name>`

```bash
# List all meow sessions
tmux ls | grep meow-

# Attach to watch an agent
tmux attach -t meow-abc123-main-agent

# Detach without stopping: Ctrl-b d
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Active workflows with step status
meow status

# Live updates
meow status --watch

# JSON output for scripting
meow status --json

# List agent sessions
meow agents

# Execution trace (debugging)
meow trace <workflow-id>
```

## Standard Library

The lib/ directory contains reusable templates.

### Agent Persistence (Ralph Wiggum Pattern)

Keep agents working even when they "finish" prematurely:

```toml
[[main.steps]]
id = "persist"
executor = "expand"
template = "lib/agent-persistence#monitor"
needs = ["spawn-agent"]
```

How it works:
1. Agent's stop hook emits `meow event agent-stopped`
2. Monitor template waits via `meow await-event`
3. On event, monitor nudges agent to continue
4. Loop until main task completes

### Claude Events Setup

Configure Claude's hooks to emit MEOW events:

```toml
[[main.steps]]
id = "setup-hooks"
executor = "expand"
template = "lib/claude-events#setup-stop-hook"
needs = ["spawn"]
```

### Context Monitor

Watch for context size warnings:

```toml
[[main.steps]]
id = "context-watch"
executor = "expand"
template = "lib/claude-utils#context-monitor"
needs = ["spawn"]
```

### Worktree Creation

Isolate work in a git worktree:

```toml
[[main.steps]]
id = "create-worktree"
executor = "expand"
template = "lib/worktree#create"
[main.steps.vars]
branch = "{{branch}}"
```

## Basic Template Structure

```toml
# Template metadata
[main]
name = "my-workflow"
description = "Does something useful"

# Variables (required or with defaults)
[main.vars]
task = { required = true }
timeout = { default = "30m" }

# Steps execute based on dependencies (needs)
[[main.steps]]
id = "start-agent"
executor = "spawn"
agent = "main"
adapter = "claude"

[[main.steps]]
id = "do-work"
executor = "agent"
agent = "main"
needs = ["start-agent"]
prompt = """
Your task: {{task}}

When complete, run: meow done --output result=success
"""

[[main.steps]]
id = "cleanup"
executor = "kill"
agent = "main"
needs = ["do-work"]
```

## Teaching Your Agent

Create `AGENTS.md` or add to `CLAUDE.md` to teach agents the MEOW protocol:

```markdown
## MEOW Workflow Protocol

When working in a MEOW workflow:

1. Check if `MEOW_ORCH_SOCK` is set (indicates MEOW context)
2. Complete your assigned task fully
3. Call `meow done` when finished
4. Use `--output key=value` to pass data to downstream steps
5. If blocked, emit `meow event <type>` with context

Important: ALWAYS call `meow done` when your task is complete.
The orchestrator waits for this signal.
```

## Key Constraints

1. **Step IDs cannot contain dots** - dots are reserved for expansion prefixes
2. **Gates are not an executor** - use `branch` with `meow await-approval`
3. **Single writer** - all state changes go through the orchestrator
4. **7 executors only** - no custom executors
